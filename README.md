# 2D Shooting Game in Processing

## Overview
This project is a simple 2D shooting game created using Processing, a programming language and environment designed for visual arts. In this game, players control a character that can move left and right while shooting bullets at enemies that appear from the right side of the screen.
This demonstrates basic programming skills in game development and offers a fun way to engage with coding concepts!

## Features
- **Character Movement**: You can move the character using the left and right arrow keys.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Clicking the mouse allows you to shoot bullets towards the enemies.
- **Enemy Behavior**: Enemies move across the screen, and you need to hit them with bullets to score points.
- **Game End Conditions**: The game ends if an enemy reaches the left edge of the screen or if all enemies are defeated.
